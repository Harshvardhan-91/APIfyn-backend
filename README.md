## üöÄ What Am I Building?

The APIfyn backend is a secure, scalable, and extensible API service built with modern technologies:

- **Node.js & Express** for high-performance REST APIs
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability

- **Firebase Auth** for secure user authentication
- **Razorpay** for subscription and payment management
- **Neon/PostgreSQL** for cloud-native data storage

### Core Capabilities

- **User Authentication:** Fast, secure login and registration via Firebase
- **Subscription Management:** Flexible plans (Free, Starter, Professional, Enterprise) with automated payments and usage limits
- **Workflow Automation:** Design, execute, and monitor custom workflows with multiple trigger types (manual, webhook, schedule, etc.)
- **API Key Management:** Issue and manage API keys for secure, granular access
- **Integrations:** Connect with popular SaaS tools (Gmail, Slack, Notion, Google Sheets, Airtable, and more)
- **Usage Tracking:** Real-time monitoring of API calls, workflow executions, and quota enforcement
- **Notifications:** Stay informed with in-app alerts for workflow status, integration events, and quota warnings
- **Role-Based Access:** Fine-grained permissions for users and admins
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Comprehensive error management and activity logging
- **Environment Configuration:** Secure management of secrets and environment variables
